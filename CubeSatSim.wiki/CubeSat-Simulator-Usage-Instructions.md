This page describes how to use your CubeSat Simulator.

The CubeSat Simulator runs on either DC power input (via the power plug), battery power (from the 9V NiMH battery inside), or from both solar power and the battery (when it is illuminated by sunlight or a warm source of light such as halogen lamp).  The DC power input connects via the barrel connector.

The Remove Before Flight switch is a pin (actually a 3.5mm audio plug) that has the red "Remove Before Flight" tag attached to it.  To run on DC power, the pin should be inserted (make sure it is plugged in all the way) and the DC power input plugged in. When you aren't using the Simulator, you should leave it plugged in and the RBF switch plugged in.

To "launch" the simulator, unplug the DC power input.  Remove the RBF pin.  Do a countdown, then press and release the push button on the Simulator.  After about 45 seconds, the Simulator will start transmitting telemetry.

To get the nice current pulses in your telemetry, place the Simulator on the rotating turntable.  This will simulate the rotation (spinning) of CubeSats in space.

If you run out of battery, the Simulator will automatically shut down.  You will then need to plug in the RBF pin and the DC power in and charge for a little while before powering it up again.

To shut it down, press and hold the button for about 3 seconds.  If you just press and release it, the Simulator will reboot.

When shipping, shut down the Simulator, unplug the RBF pin and the DC power plug.  Pop open the top and look for the 9V battery leads. By carefully pulling on those leads, you can lift the battery out.  Unplug the battery from the connector and put a piece of electrical tape over the connector.  If you don't have any, put the battery in a ziplock or other plastic bag so that nothing can short the terminals. The simulator is now ready to ship - don't forget to pack the DC power pack and the RBF pin!
